        <h2>KATHNIEL'S IN 12 YEARS</h2>
        <p>12 years as a loveteam, and a successful one at that, KathNiel truly created a legacy in the industry.

                <p>They were part of the 2011 teen drama "Growing Up" which is about a group of friends who collectively discovers and understands valuable truths about love, family, relationships and life in general. But doing so proves to be no easy task, as each of them discover their respective strengths and weaknesses that challenge the way they think, dream, and love, and in so doing become obstacles to their objective. In the end, they manage to reap the reward they worked for, only to find out that it’s better than they hoped for. In one of her recent videos, the 25-year-old actress asked Daniel if he had any regrets on starting their relationship so young, as they had met when they were only 16 and 17, respectively. “Hindi ah,” Daniel answered firmly.</p>
